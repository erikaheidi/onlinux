The [Keychron K6](https://amzn.to/3uDWVu2) is a mechanical keyboard with a compact layout that offers a few different variations to choose from: with or without RGB LEds, choice of switches, plastic or aluminium plate as base. You can connect multiple devices via Bluetooth and USB-C. It works well on Linux, Windows, MacOS, and also on Android phones and tablets (via bluetooth). 

What I like the most about this model is its size; I can easily hold it with one hand, and it fits well most backpacks. It is approximately the same size of my 14' laptop in length. The keys are very comfortable to type. I enjoy the typing sound of the brown switches and the "feedback" you get from typing.

This is a versatile keyboard that works well for travelling. The downside is that you don't have the upper row of F-keys, with both numbers, symbols, and F-keys combined in one top row where each key has 2 additional types / functions that are accessed with the special `fn1` and `fn2` keys. It takes some time to get used to this scheme, but since these are mostly media control keys and shortcuts, you won't be using the `fn` keys _that_ much, with exception for the ESC key that also contains the backtick (`) and tilde (~) characters.
