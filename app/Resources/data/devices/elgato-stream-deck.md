The [Elgato Stream Deck](https://amzn.to/35hzCxo) is a customizable compact keyboard popular with live streamers. It has configurable buttons and can be set up on Linux with a Python application called [streamdeck-ui](https://timothycrosley.github.io/streamdeck-ui/). This app has a graphic interface that you can use to pair each button with a command or keyboard shortcut.

## OnLinux Review

- **Works on Linux?** 
   - **Yes.** It's not entirely plug and play as you'll need to install a software to map buttons, but it works pretty well, and it's very reliable once you get this software auto-starting at login.
- **Tested with** 
   - Ubuntu 21.04 
   - Ubuntu 21.10
