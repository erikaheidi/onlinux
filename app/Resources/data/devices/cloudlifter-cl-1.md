The [Cloudlifter CL-1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MQSV04/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1) is a microphone pre-amp / lifter / activator that gives a boost to the sound captured by your dynamic microphone. It is strongly recommended as a companion device for the [Shure SMB7](/devices/shure-smb7) microphone.

## OnLinux Review

- **Works on Linux?**
  - This device does not connect directly to a computer, it is used between the microphone and the audio interface. It works at the hardware level.
- **Tested with**
  - Ubuntu 21.04+
