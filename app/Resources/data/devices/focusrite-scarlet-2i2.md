The [Focusrite Scarlet 2i2](https://amzn.to/3uveI6j) is an audio interface with two mic/line/instrument inputs that basically lets you connect microphones and other equipment compatible with [XLR cables](https://amzn.to/3uvViym) to your computer via USB. It offers studio-quality recording for both voice and instruments, and that's one of the reasons they are so popular with podcasters along with a [Shure SMB7 microphone](/devices/shure-smb7).

## OnLinux Review

- **Works on Linux?**
  - **Yes.** You don't need any extra software on Ubuntu 21.04+, the device connects via USB and becomes an audio device that you can set up as input / microphone called "Scarlet i2i audio interface". Make sure you toggle the "48V" button to enable [phantom power](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/what-phantom-power-need/#) if you are using it with a device that requires it.
- **Tested with**
  - Ubuntu 21.04, 21.10
