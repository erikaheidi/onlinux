Choosing a microphone is never an easy task, so it can be helpful to compare recordings from different microphones and choose what works best for you.

In this page you'll find a list of audio samples recorded using different microphones. All samples were recorded using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) on Ubuntu 21.10.

_Ps: I will keep adding new samples here as I get to test new microphones._

### Shure SMB7
A professional microphone especially designed for capturing voice. Definitely the best microphone I have tried so far. This mic requires additional devices to be connected to your computer (check [the device page](/devices/shure-smb7) for more info).

Clean recording without background noise:

Recording with background noise:

### Corsair Virtuoso Headset
The Corsair virtuoso headset can be used both as USB wired and as wireless device. The wireless operation requires a USB dongle to be connected to the machine. The sound quality is quite ok, but the microphone is a surprising good find. Because it's directional and stays right in front of your mouth, the headset microphone (which is detachable) doesn't capture much background noise, making it ideal for gaming (and hands-free  meetings).

### Shure Aonic Earphones
A noise-cancelling earphone from Shure, seems popular with musicians. Although the sound quality on this device is fantastic, the microphone is not that good unfortunately.

### Built-in microphone - Lenovo Carbon
As with any built-in laptop microphone, this one captures a lot of background noise.
