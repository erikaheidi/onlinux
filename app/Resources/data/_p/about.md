On Linux Systems is a project created by [Erika Heidi](https://twitter.com/erikaheidi) to document experiences with different kinds of hardware, gadgets, and software on Linux systems.

The project is [open source](https://github.com/erikaheidi/onlinux), built in PHP with the [Librarian](https://github.com/librarianphp/librarian) experimental markdown framework. 

We have an open [discussions group](https://github.com/erikaheidi/onlinux/discussions) on GitHub where you can ask questions about gadgets and software on Linux as well make suggestions about interesting gadgets to review.

We'll be accepting content contributions once the basic website is up and running, and the project itself is better documented.
